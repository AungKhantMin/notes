Concepts
    Each region is an independent set of data centres.

    **Availability zones**: interconnected data centres within the same region isolated from failures. They are connected with low latency network.

    **Hybrid deployment**: mix of cloud and on premises.

    You can achieve high availability by deploying the data/components in two availability zones within the same region

    **AWS config**: provides resource inventory and configuration history.

Security and identity services

    **Identity and access management (Iam)**: creation of users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny access to their AWS.

    **Key management service (kms)**: creates and controlles encryption keys. Integrates with other services to encrypt data.

    **Directory service**: set up and run Microsoft active directory.

    **Certificate manager**: provisions, manages and deploys tls certificates.

    **Web application firewall**: blocks malicious traffic.

Other services

    **API gateway**: Makes it easy to create and deploy apis.

    **Simple notification system (SNS)**: producer subscriber system to send messages and consume data.

    **Simple email service (SES)**: system to send emails.

    **Simple workflow service (SWF)**: system to execute tasks, if one fail it reruns.

    **Simple queue service (SQS)**: cost effective queue.

Simple Storage Service (S3)
    Common use cases:
        Backup and archive
        Content and media distribution
        Big data analysis
        Static website hosting
        Disaster recovery
        Data reside in buckets

    Provides REST API with CRUD (create read update delete) operations

    You don’t have to worry about storage limits or capacity planning or durability. Efficient for frequently accessed data.

    Each bucket can hold unlimited objects of up to 5TB and lives in a single region.

    Each object is identified with a key and has metadata associated

    **Concurrency**: Eventual consistency for updated data and read-after-write for new data.

    **Access control**: iam policies, query string auth and s3 bucket policies.

    You can use prefixes for object hierarchy aggregation.

    **Reduce Reduncancy Storage (RRS)**: strategy with cheaper price less redundancy
    **Infrequent Access (IA)**: strategy with les bandwidth.

    You can set lifecycle rules: where data is moved to IA or RRS.

    Supports versioning if objects.

    **MFA delete**: Deleting an object requires an extra token.

    **Cross region replication**: async replicate all objects to another region. Good to reduce latency

    You can set up **logging** of requests.

    **Events notifications** can be sent after events such as upload. Can be sent to an SQS, SNS, or a lambda.

    You can specify world readable, IAM permissions or temporary public URLs that expire.

Amazon Glacier
    Low-cost storage service, good for long term backups and for infrequently used data storage.
    Data is stored in *archives**, each can hold up to 40TB of data and is referenced by an **ID**, not a user-friendly key.
    **Vaults** are containers of archives, you can have up to 1000 vaults. Each vault can have different IAM policies.
    You can also specify lock policies, such as write once read many (WORM).
    You can retrieve 5% of the data for free every month.
    Encryption at rest can not be disabled.

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
    Resizable compute capacity. Virtual machines are called **instances**.
    Each instance type has CPU, memory, storage and network performance. There are different instance families (m,t,s...) each scales the price and the property of the family linear. Network performance increases as the family type grows (Up to 10Gbps).
    Families
        Compute optimized (c4)
        Memory optimized (r3)
        Storage optimized (i2)
        GPU-based instances (gs)
    **Amazon machine images (AMIs)**: Is a OS image, usually contains patches and additional apps. Are based on x86 Windows/Linux. Can be:
        Published by AWS
        Marketplace: Customers can provide and sell their AMIs.
        Generated from existing instances: Facilitates reusing instances.
        Uploaded virtual servers: exported from vmware, virtualbox or others.
    Addressing
        DNS: each instance gets a unique domain name
        Public IP
        Elastic IP: reserved IP, not tight to an instance.
    Access is granted through public key authentication.
    **Security groups**: is a virtual firewall that allows you to allow traffic from or to certain ports and IPs. You can associate it with an EC2 instance or a VPC. By default denies everything.
    **User data** is a script you can pass to the instance that runs after startup, to do initialization tasks. It is not encrypted.
    Each instance has metadata associated, it can be found at **http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data**. It includes security groups, instance Id, type amd AMI.
    You can set Tags (key-value) to your instances to easily identify them.
    You can monitor instances using **Cloudwatch**.
    Instances can be resized.
    Pricing
        **On-demand**:  no upfront commitment, fixed price.
        **Reserved instances**: You can save up to 75% if you commit to a certain time. Price will vary depending on the time and if you pay upfront. You can improve specs after purchase.
        **Spot instances**: Customer specified how much he is willing to pay for the instance. If they pricing goes below the requested one, you will get a machine until it goes up again. Cheapest option. Should only be used for workloads tolerant to interruption.
    Tenancy options
        **Shared tenancy**: Default option, same host machine might host instances from different customers.
        **Dedicated instances**: Run on hardware that's dedicated t o a single customer.
        **Dedicated host**: Customer has more granularity and can specify which host to run the instance. It is also fully dedicated for the customer.
    **Placement groups** enable applications to particiapte in low-latency 10Gbps network. The instanc must support it.
    **Instance store**

    Instance types
        *Instance stores**: Ephemeral storage of HDDs or SSDs attached to the host machine. Very cost effective, ideal for temporary storage (caches, buffers). Data is lost if the instance terminates or reboots.

        **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent block-level storage to use in EC2. It is automatically replicated in the availability zone. They can be attached to a single instance.
        Types:
            **Magnetic volumes**: lowest performance and lowest cost per GB. From 1GB to 1TB, 100 IOPS on average. Good solution for data accessed infrequently, sequential reads.

        **General purpose SSD**: Strong performance, moderate price. From 1GB to 16TB. 3 IOPS per GB, up to 10K IOPS. I.E 1TB-> 3K IOPS. Good for medium sized DBs, boot volumes and dev envs.

        **Provisioned IOPS SSD**: Highest performance, highest price, from 4GB to 16TB. Well suited for business critical apps with large performance, large DBs workloads.


    **Snapshots** allow you to backup a EBS volume taking a point in time snapshot. Are stored in S3 technology. You pay for the storage cost. Storage in the same region, you will need to copy it if need an instance in different region.

    EBS offers native encryption, through **Key Management System (KMS)** to handle key management. Data is encrypted using AES256. Snapshots from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted, as volumes created from snapshots.
